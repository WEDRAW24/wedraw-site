      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        WEDRAW emerged from the belief that great events begin with great design. It combines a passion for drawing with a committed, technical approach to creating and bringing bold visions to life.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        I've always loved events, but my journey began in architecture, where I developed an eye for detail and a strong focus on problem-solving. Seeing the potential to apply these skills and passion, I pursued opportunities to apply my expertise in the event industry, working on major projects like <em>Boomtown</em> and <em>Bristol International Balloon Fiesta</em>.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        Following years of growth and learning, I founded WEDRAW with a dedication to transforming spaces into unforgettable experiences.

      <h2 className="subtitle mb-6 mt-12">Collaboration: The Foundation of Exceptional Design</h2>
      
      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        At the heart of WEDRAW is the understanding that every project is a collective effort. We bring together talented contractors and suppliers to ensure that every aspect of the design reflects both the creative vision and the practical needs of the event.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        As designers, it's our responsibility to take the time to truly understand the full scope of an event, its ambitions, and its limitations, and to ensure that everyone involved is working towards the optimum solution, one where creativity and functionality work hand-in-hand, ensuring every requirement is carefully considered. When done right, this approach not only keeps events safe and running smoothly but also elevates the entire experience for both attendees and those working behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="subtitle mb-6 mt-12">Looking Ahead: The Journey is Just Beginning</h2>
      
      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        We're just beginning our journey, small, but with big dreams and an eagerness to grow and improve. Above all, we believe in collaboration and creating experiences that aren't just something truly memorable. But great events don't happen by accident, they're built on precision, thoughtful, intentional design, and great communication. That's why collaboration matters. WEDRAW is ready to work alongside those who share our passion for turning spaces into unforgettable experiences.
