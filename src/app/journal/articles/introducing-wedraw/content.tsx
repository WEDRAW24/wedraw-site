        <strong className="text-blueprint">WEDRAW</strong> was founded out of a shared desire to make event planning work better. <strong className="text-blueprint">Driven by curiosity</strong> and a belief that there are smarter ways of working, we look beyond our own industry for ideas that can strengthen it. Our interest in effective tools and proven methods across different sectors shapes how we approach site planning, not to replace what already works, but to build on it. By applying the right ideas in the right way, we aim to make planning <strong className="text-blueprint">more intuitive, more collaborative, and more reliable</strong>, helping event teams achieve better outcomes without losing what makes our industry unique.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        <strong className="text-blueprint">WEDRAW</strong> is a space founded to make event planning easier and more enjoyable. We (Theo and Chris) are both self-confessed incurably curious people, drawing inspiration from a wide spectrum of industries and materials. <strong className="text-blueprint">Our passion is to bring these ideas into the events industry we love, to strengthen it and the important creative work it does.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        Our backgrounds span architectural design, blacksmithing and site management. Moving between disciplines has taught us to question assumptions and look for better ways of doing things. This mindset shapes the <strong className="text-blueprint">WEDRAW</strong> Studio, where we aim to improve the planning process for all events by <strong className="text-blueprint">sharing knowledge, refining workflows, and developing better tools</strong>. It means looking at the process as a whole, not just the final output.
      </p>

      <h2 className="subtitle mb-6 mt-12">So, how do we do this?</h2>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        <strong className="text-blueprint">We pull events out of spreadsheets and into visual spatial plans.</strong> We begin with the facts and the data, drawing from landscape information, topographical surveys and site constraints, before layering in land use, operational requirements and the needs of event teams across both planning and live phases. Here the <strong className="text-blueprint">&lsquo;WE&rsquo;</strong> comes to the forefront of the process, developing through collaboration between crews and stakeholders as they <strong className="text-blueprint">build a shared understanding</strong> of <strong className="text-blueprint">how the event sits within the physical landscape</strong> before any boots hit the ground.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        Once the venue map and event specifics are established, the <strong className="text-blueprint">&lsquo;DRAW&rsquo;</strong> becomes a space for exploration. For us, drawings are not just representations of space; they are a way of <strong className="text-blueprint">thinking, testing, and communicating ideas clearly</strong>. Site planning is inherently <strong className="text-blueprint">iterative</strong>, and each version plays an active role in shaping the final outcome. Drawings help teams <strong className="text-blueprint">test scenarios, understand intent, and spot potential issues</strong> early, allowing a thorough, well-thought-out design to evolve through refinement and avoid potential problems on site.
      </p>

      <h2 className="subtitle mb-6 mt-12">From page to place:</h2>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        The <strong className="text-blueprint">&lsquo;DRAW&rsquo;</strong> extends to the ground. We take the translation from visual design to physical reality seriously, using site visits and design checks to ensure accuracy before build begins. We then work in partnership with event teams to translate this layout into clear, precise marks on the ground, giving infrastructure teams and suppliers the confidence to build from a shared reference point. By reducing stress and guesswork during the build phase, crews are able to focus on delivering their part of the whole.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        Drawings alone aren&rsquo;t the whole picture; the wider systems around them matter just as much. How updates are managed, who can make changes when, and how approvals are handled all <strong className="text-blueprint">shape whether a planning process feels controlled or chaotic</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="body-lg mb-6">
        <strong className="text-blueprint">WEDRAW sits at the point where information, design, and collaboration meet.</strong> We work with event teams to collect and structure site data, develop clear and accurate drawings, and manage how information moves through the planning process. By supporting both the technical detail and the wider coordination around site plans, we help teams stay aligned, reduce friction, and move <strong className="text-blueprint">from concept to showdays with greater clarity and confidence</strong>.
